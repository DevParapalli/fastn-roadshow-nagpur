# fastn-me-docs

- Flow to create a new project
    1. Install fastn cli - `curl -fsSL https://fastn.com/install.sh | sh`
    2. Create a new project - `fastn create-project <name>`
    3. modify .ftd files to add content.

## Improvements

1. Add a --open attribute to serve. This will open the browser automatically.
2. Add a auto-refresh on file change, using a file watcher.
3. Add a component creator or a component generator.
4. Add dependency manager. one that installs dependencies and sets up the auto-imports.
5. Add a set of reuseable CSS rules (CSS rulesets ????)...
6. Search capability for docs, enable searching for stuff like $inherited.colors......
7. More straight forward path for development, the current guided flow is too cumbersome.
8. Give more insights on the CSS properties, at least the basics one such as border, padding, margin, alignment and their units
